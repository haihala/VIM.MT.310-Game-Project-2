# Running the game
Exported windows and linux build. Those are in the builds folder. Couldn't notorize a mac build.

Use left and right arrows to move. Up to jump.

# Graphics
Added the kings and pigs asset pack I found in itch.io
https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/kings-and-pigs

- Made a tileset and painted the world with them
- Player
	- Used the king human sprites
	- Added animations for idle, running, jumping, falling, landing and dying
- Pig
	- Added a pig that will eventually become an enemy
	- Used the pig sprites
	- Now it has an idle animation and looks at you. Menacingly
- Particles
	- For landing (lots) and for running (some)
	- Made them in godot

# Audio
Added the RPG Audio pack from kenney.nl
https://www.kenney.nl/assets/rpg-audio

- Made it play a sound when the character is running or picks up a diamond

# Behavior
- Made a basic finite state machine for the player
	- Maintaining the state information was getting overwhelming and I'm planning on adding more states
- Rewrote the movement system
	- I felt the existing one didn't feel great
	- The current one is relatively weighty which fits the player sprite


# Plans
- Hopefully I'll get some basic combat going next part.
	- Using that as an excuse to add all sorts of sound effects here and there.
- Landing is currently quiet which is weird.
