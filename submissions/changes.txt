# Running the game

Exported windows and linux build. Those are in the builds folder. Couldn't notorize a mac build.

Use left and right arrows to move. Up to jump. Space to attack (only on the ground)

# Previously added assets

Added the kings and pigs asset pack I found in itch.io
https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/kings-and-pigs

Added the RPG Audio pack from kenney.nl
https://www.kenney.nl/assets/rpg-audio

# Systems

- Added an attack
- Added a health system
- Removed score
- Added destructible boxes
- Added a little pause after landing before you can move
- Made pig fight you, run to you, and jump if it can't reach
- Made diamonds transport you to new levels

# Visuals

- Added animations to
	- Player's attack and taking damage
	- The pig running, attacking, jumping, taking damage, dying, and getting back up
- Added a speech bubble when the pig goes down and gets back up
- Added a health bar with pulsing hearts.
	- The heartbeat speeds up if you get lower in health.
- Sped up player walk animation

# Audio

Added the Minifantasy - Dungeon Audio Pack from itch.io
https://leohpaz.itch.io/minifantasy-dungeon-sfx-pack

- Added a sound effect to
	- Player's attack, taking a hit, dying, and landing
	- The pig taking damage and dying
- Added background music from the same pack

# Under the hood

- Reworked player's state machine, as previous implementation wasn't great
- Added a generic component to play a random audio clip. No idea why this isn't in the engine already.
- Refactored levels for easier loading

# Goals for next stage

- Levels 
	- Tutorial
	- Level 1 - Basic pig
	- Level 2 - Cannon pig
	- Level 3 - Boss pig 1 (will run away after after the fight)
	- Level 4 - Bomber pig
	- Level 5 - Boss pig 2 with basic pig, bomber pig and a cannon as backup
- Main menu
- End screen
- Refactor state machine to move more code into the states

Unlike last phase, I find it very unlikely to get everything here done.
