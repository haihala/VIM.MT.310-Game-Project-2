# Running the game

Exported windows and linux build. Those are in the builds folder. Couldn't notorize a mac build.

Use left and right arrows to move. Up to jump. Space to attack (only on the ground)

# Foes

## Cannon Pig

Added a pig that fires a cannon. Sound effects were provided by SamsterBirdies on freesound
https://freesound.org/people/SamsterBirdies/sounds/581597/
https://freesound.org/people/Rickplayer/sounds/530486/

Animations were from the kings and pigs pack.

## King Pig

Added a king pig as a boss. Assets were from the previously listed sources.

# Start screen

Added a start screen that begrudgingly allows you to play the game. I'd like to clarify that I'm not against you playing the game, the game is.

Made you exit out of it by pressing the left arrow, as that will make your character move into the tutorial diamond.

# Levels

- Added a start screen that lets you pick a level
- Added a three stage tutorial that explains the mechanics of the game.
- Added three levels that test the player with various trials, culminating in a boss fight.
- Added an end screen that provides a hollow congratulation and an opportunity to play again
- If player plays again, they get taken to the next round with similar but harder levels. There are a total of four rounds with the last ones being rather difficult.

It took about 25 mins to complete by an unaware playtester without assistance.

# Game design ramblings

## Levels

Every level in the game should show the player something new.

### Round 1
#### Level select
- Diamonds transport you to new levels

#### Tutorial
- Controls in more detail
- Obtuse messages that contrasts with the assets
- Combat against basic pigs
- Pigs drop diamonds sometimes

#### Level 1
- Cannon pigs exist
- Cannon balls can be avoided by going under them
- Sometimes you have to jump over the cannon balls

#### Level 2
- Diamonds drop when the last enemy dies
- Sometimes you need to juggle multiple enemies

#### Level 3
- Bosses exist

#### End screen
- The game doesn't care if you play it. It would probably even prefer if you didn't.

### Round 2
#### Level select
- There is no tutorial diamond -> Something has changed -> Game changes even when it said it didn't

#### Level 1
- You only need to be one tile lower than the cannon to get under the cannon balls

#### Level 2
- Pigs will get stuck on each other
- Multiple regular pigs don't pose significantly more of a threat than single regular pigs

#### Level 3
- The boss evolves
	- Round 2 onwards the boss can't be hit when it's attacking or already getting hit

Giving players a sense of cheating the game is effective.
Many games do it, but the boss evolution makes the player aware that the game knows it's being cheated.
You can sit still and hold the attack button to beat the Round 1 boss, as it gets stunlocked very easily.
Your tactics may become obsolete and you should look out for that.

### Round 3
#### Level 1
- You never needed the holes in the ground to avoid the balls, as the ceiling was high enough to jump over

#### Level 2
- Multiple cannons can exist on a level, they are still a higher priority than the standard pigs

#### Level 3
- The boss develops a charge move
	- You can parry it by landing an attack on it.
	- Every game improves from adding a parry
- Kiting is good and all, but you can't get too far
- Before this point the boss has a blindspot if you stand on top of him, but that stops working here.

### Round 4
#### Level 1
- You can still jump over the cannon balls, even with the low ceiling

#### Level 2
- Multiple cannons start forming a pattern

#### Level 3
- Good old double boss move.
	- They even play together somewhat.

## Pacing

The second level of each round is intentionally easier than the one before or after.
The first and the third level are the hardest and the second level gives the player a breather after the first while the levels without enemies give a break after level 3.
